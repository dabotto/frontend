            <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March, 18th, 2026</p>

            <p>
                This application, including its user interface, scripts, smart-contract integrations, transaction facilitation logic,
                token interaction modules, RPC connectivity mechanisms, reward calculation displays, liquidity management tools,
                and any associated documentation or visual outputs (collectively, the “Software”), is provided exclusively as part
                of an <strong>ongoing experimental research and development project</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Software is not intended to constitute a finished product, financial service, regulated investment interface,
                custodial solution, brokerage system, or professional advisory tool of any kind.
            </p>

            <p>
                By accessing, connecting a wallet to, interacting with, or otherwise using the Software, you expressly acknowledge,
                represent, and agree to the following:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Experimental and Unstable Nature</h3>
            <p>
                The Software is <strong>highly experimental, unaudited, subject to material defects, and under continuous modification</strong>.
                Features, design logic, economic assumptions, transaction flows, integrations, and security properties may change,
                degrade, malfunction, or be permanently discontinued <strong>at any time and without prior notice</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>No assurance is given that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the Software will function correctly or consistently;</li>
                <li>displayed balances, rewards, token values, or liquidity metrics will be accurate;</li>
                <li>transactions initiated through the interface will behave as visually represented;</li>
                <li>integrations with smart contracts will remain compatible or safe.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Blockchain and Smart-Contract Risk Acknowledgment</h3>
            <p>
                You understand that interactions facilitated by the Software involve <strong>permissionless decentralized blockchain protocols</strong>
                which are inherently unpredictable and irreversible.
            </p>
            <p>Such interactions may expose you to, without limitation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>permanent and unrecoverable loss of digital assets;</li>
                <li>smart-contract exploits or economic design failures;</li>
                <li>malicious token implementations;</li>
                <li>approval misuse or unintended asset transfers;</li>
                <li>liquidity pool insolvency or extreme market volatility;</li>
                <li>miner / validator front-running or transaction reordering;</li>
                <li>protocol governance changes affecting asset value or accessibility.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All blockchain transactions are executed <strong>entirely at your own initiative and risk</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Third-Party Infrastructure Dependency</h3>
            <p>
                The Software relies on external systems beyond the control of its creators, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>RPC nodes and infrastructure providers;</li>
                <li>wallet software and browser-injected providers;</li>
                <li>network validators and block producers;</li>
                <li>token metadata sources and indexing services;</li>
                <li>decentralized liquidity protocols.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Failures, delays, manipulation, outages, data inconsistencies, or security incidents affecting any such systems may result in
                <strong>financial loss, inability to transact, inaccurate UI outputs, or degraded functionality</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>4. No Financial, Legal, or Technical Advice</h3>
            <p>Nothing presented through the Software constitutes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>financial advice;</li>
                <li>investment solicitation;</li>
                <li>portfolio recommendation;</li>
                <li>legal or tax guidance;</li>
                <li>technical assurance of protocol safety.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You remain solely responsible for performing <strong>independent due diligence</strong> regarding all digital asset interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                No fiduciary duty, agency relationship, partnership, or advisory obligation is created by your use of the Software.
            </p>

            <p>
                You assume the entire risk arising out of the use or performance of the Software.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Limitation and Exclusion of Liability</h3>
            <p>
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, under no circumstances shall the creators, developers, designers, contributors,
                maintainers, infrastructure operators, hosting providers, or any related persons or entities be liable for any:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>loss of digital assets, tokens, rewards, or liquidity;</li>

                This limitation applies <strong>regardless of the legal theory asserted</strong>, including contract, tort, negligence,
                strict liability, or otherwise, and even if the possibility of such damages was foreseeable.
            </p>

            <h3>7. No Compensation, Refund, or Indemnification</h3>
            <p>
                You expressly agree that <strong>no compensation, reimbursement, refund, or indemnification</strong> shall be owed by the creators
                or contributors for any losses or damages arising from:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>software malfunction;</li>
                <li>user interface inaccuracies;</li>

            <h3>8. User Assumption of Total Risk</h3>
            <p>
                By continuing to use the Software, you irrevocably confirm that you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>fully understand the experimental and high-risk nature of decentralized finance;</li>
                <li>voluntarily assume all technological, financial, and regulatory risks;</li>
                <li>accept that losses may be <strong>total, permanent, and unrecoverable</strong>;</li>
                <li>waive any present or future claim against the creators related to such losses.</li>
            </ul>
